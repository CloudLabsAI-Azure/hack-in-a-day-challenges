# AI-Powered Clinical Research Intelligence Assistant

Welcome to the AI-Powered Clinical Research Intelligence Hack in a Day!  
In this lab, you will build an intelligent AI agent that helps clinical researchers navigate vast volumes of unstructured medical literature and patient case studies. The solution enables researchers to ask complex, natural-language questions and receive evidence-based, citation-backed insights in seconds instead of weeks.

Using Microsoft Foundry (Azure OpenAI), Azure AI Search, Azure Blob Storage, and Streamlit, you will design an end-to-end clinical research assistant that accelerates literature review, supports trial design, and enables faster, data-driven decision-making in healthcare research.

## Scenario

Clinical researchers and medical teams regularly analyze thousands of medical papers, trial reports, and patient case studies to stay current on treatment effectiveness and regulatory approvals. This manual process is time-consuming, error-prone, and slows down research and patient care decisions.

To address this challenge, the healthcare research team decides to build an **AI-powered Clinical Research Intelligence Assistant**. This assistant indexes unstructured medical documents such as synthetic PubMed-style articles and clinical trial summaries, allowing researchers to query topics like:

- “What are the latest treatments for glioblastoma in patients over 60?”
- “Compare outcomes of chemotherapy vs immunotherapy”
- “Which treatments are FDA approved?”

The AI agent provides grounded answers with citations, comparisons, and regulatory context, significantly reducing research timelines.

## Introduction

Your mission is to build a **Clinical Research Intelligence Assistant** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The solution will ingest unstructured medical documents into Azure Blob Storage, index them using Azure AI Search, and connect the indexed knowledge to a Foundry-powered AI agent. A Streamlit-based chat interface will allow users to interact with the data conversationally.

This lab demonstrates how Generative AI can transform healthcare research by making complex medical knowledge easily accessible, explainable, and actionable.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Store unstructured healthcare documents in Azure Blob Storage  
- Index medical literature using Azure AI Search for semantic retrieval  
- Deploy and use Large Language Models via Microsoft Foundry  
- Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for grounded AI responses  
- Generate citation-backed clinical insights using AI prompts  
- Build a Streamlit-based chat interface for clinical research queries  

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hands-on lab is structured into progressive challenges that simulate building a real-world healthcare AI solution:

- **Challenge 01: Upload and Review Clinical Research Documents**  
  Store synthetic medical literature and patient case studies in Azure Blob Storage.

- **Challenge 02: Deploy Foundry Models for Clinical Analysis**  
  Deploy LLM and embedding models required for healthcare text understanding.

- **Challenge 03: Index Medical Literature with Azure AI Search**  
  Create a searchable knowledge base with vectorization for RAG.

- **Challenge 04: Analyze Clinical Data Using GenAI Prompts**  
  Query indexed medical data using Foundry Studio playground.

- **Challenge 05: Run the Clinical Research Assistant Application**  
  Configure and launch a Streamlit application for conversational querying.

## Challenge Overview

You will begin by uploading synthetic medical research documents to Azure Blob Storage. Next, you will deploy Foundry models and create an Azure AI Search index with vector embeddings. You will then test clinical queries using GenAI prompts and finally deploy a Streamlit-based chat application that enables natural-language exploration of medical literature.

By the end of this Hack in a Day, you will have a fully functional **Clinical Research Intelligence Assistant** that accelerates literature review and supports evidence-based healthcare research.
