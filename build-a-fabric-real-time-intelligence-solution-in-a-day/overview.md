# Build A Fabric Real-Time Intelligence Solution in a Day

Welcome to the Fabric Real-Time Intelligence Hack in a Day! Today, you'll explore the power of streaming analytics by building a complete real-time intelligence solution using Microsoft Fabric. Through this hands-on experience, you'll learn how to design a data pipeline that can ingest, process, and visualize streaming events for immediate business insights and automated decision-making.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create a real-time analytics pipeline that transforms how organizations handle streaming data. Leveraging Microsoft Fabric's Eventhouse, Eventstream, Lakehouse, and Data Activator, you'll design a system that can automatically ingest streaming events, create structured data layers, and provide real-time visualizations with intelligent alerting.

This solution will act as a comprehensive real-time intelligence platform integrating data ingestion, processing, storage, and automation to deliver faster, smarter, and more efficient analytics experiences for business users and data engineers alike.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Set up a Fabric Workspace and Eventhouse for real-time data ingestion and storage.
- Stream synthetic events using Eventstream and Python Notebook for data simulation.
- Integrate Eventhouse data with Lakehouse and create structured KQL database schemas.
- Build Real-Time Dashboards with auto-refresh capabilities and interactive visualizations.
- Implement automated alerts and actions using Data Activator for threshold-based monitoring.

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hack in a day adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through four progressive stages that mirror a real-world streaming analytics implementation. Each challenge focuses on a key capability of the Real-Time Intelligence Solution:

- **Challenge 1: Foundation** - Create a Fabric Workspace and Eventhouse for real-time data ingestion and storage.
- **Challenge 2: Data Streaming** - Stream synthetic events using Eventstream and Python Notebook to simulate real-time data flow.
- **Challenge 3: Data Integration** - Integrate Eventhouse with Lakehouse and build structured KQL database schemas with Silver and Gold layers.
- **Challenge 4: Visualization & Automation** - Build Real-Time Dashboard with auto-refresh and implement automated alerts using Data Activator.

Throughout each challenge, you'll:
- Analyze the streaming data requirements and business scenario.
- Strategize and design a scalable real-time analytics solution.
- Leverage your Azure environment to deploy, integrate, and test streaming components.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with setting up Microsoft Fabric workspace and Eventhouse for real-time data ingestion. You'll then implement Eventstream to simulate streaming events from web interactions. Next, you'll enhance the solution with Lakehouse integration and structured KQL databases. Finally, you'll create interactive real-time dashboards with automated alerting capabilities.

By the end of this hack in a day, you'll have a fully functional Real-Time Intelligence solution capable of streaming data ingestion, structured data processing, interactive visualization, and automated monitoring and alerting.
