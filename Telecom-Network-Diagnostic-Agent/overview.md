# AI-Powered Network Diagnostics & Optimization Assistant

Welcome to the AI-Powered Network Diagnostics Hack in a Day!  
In this lab, you will build an intelligent AI agent that helps telecom engineers monitor, diagnose, and optimize network infrastructure using telemetry data and Generative AI.

Using Microsoft Foundry (Azure OpenAI), Azure AI Search, Azure Blob Storage, and Streamlit, you will create a proactive network intelligence solution that reduces downtime and accelerates issue resolution.

## Scenario

Telecom networks generate massive volumes of telemetry data, including latency, packet loss, and hardware health metrics. Engineers often react to incidents after customers are impacted, spending significant time correlating logs and identifying root causes.

To improve reliability, the organization decides to build an **AI-powered Network Diagnostics and Optimization Assistant**. The AI agent continuously analyzes synthetic telemetry and incident reports and enables engineers to ask questions such as:

- “Why is latency high in this region?”
- “Which network components are at risk of failure?”
- “What remediation actions are recommended?”

The agent provides contextual explanations and optimization recommendations, shifting operations from reactive to proactive.

## Introduction

Your mission is to build a **Telecom Network Diagnostics Assistant** using RAG. Network telemetry and incident reports are stored in Azure Blob Storage, indexed using Azure AI Search, and connected to a Foundry-powered AI agent. A Streamlit UI enables conversational diagnostics and insight generation.

This lab demonstrates how AI can improve network reliability, reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR), and support proactive operations.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Store telecom telemetry and incident data in Azure Blob Storage  
- Index network diagnostics data using Azure AI Search  
- Deploy Foundry LLM and embedding models  
- Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for diagnostics  
- Generate explainable network insights using GenAI prompts  
- Build a Streamlit-based chat interface for telecom engineers  

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This lab is structured into progressive challenges reflecting a real-world telecom AI solution:

- **Challenge 01: Upload Network Telemetry and Incident Data**  
  Store synthetic network reports in Azure Blob Storage.

- **Challenge 02: Deploy Foundry Models for Network Analysis**  
  Deploy LLM and embedding models for telemetry interpretation.

- **Challenge 03: Index Network Data with Azure AI Search**  
  Create a semantic search index for network diagnostics.

- **Challenge 04: Analyze Network Issues Using GenAI Prompts**  
  Test diagnostics queries in Foundry Studio playground.

- **Challenge 05: Run the Network Diagnostics Application**  
  Launch a Streamlit application for conversational network analysis.

## Challenge Overview

You will ingest synthetic network telemetry, deploy AI models, and create a searchable diagnostics index. You will then test network-related prompts and deploy a Streamlit application that enables engineers to interact with network intelligence conversationally.

By the end of this Hack in a Day, you will have a fully functional **Network Diagnostics & Optimization Assistant** that transforms telecom operations into a proactive service model.
