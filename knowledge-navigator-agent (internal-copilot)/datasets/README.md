## Document Format

All documents should be in **PDF format** for upload to Microsoft Copilot Studio.

### Creating the Documents

You can create these documents in several ways:

#### Option 1: Use Sample Content Templates
Create Word documents based on the outlines above, then convert to PDF:

1. Open Microsoft Word
2. Create a document for each policy (e.g., "HR_Leave_Policy.docx")
3. Add realistic policy content based on the descriptions above
4. Include sections, headings, bullet points, and tables
5. Save as PDF: File → Save As → PDF

#### Option 2: Use AI to Generate Content
Use AI tools (like ChatGPT, Copilot, or Claude) to generate realistic policy content:

**Example Prompt:**
```
Create a comprehensive 2,500-word HR Leave Policy document for a mid-sized tech company 
that includes:
- Annual leave: 15 days per year, accrual monthly
- Sick leave: 10 days per year with doctor's note requirements
- Personal leave: 3 days per year
- Leave request and approval process
- Carryover policy (max 5 days)

Format with clear sections, professional tone, and specific procedures.
```

Then save the generated content as a Word document and export to PDF.
