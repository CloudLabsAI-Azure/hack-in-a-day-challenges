# Expense Approval Authority Matrix

**Financial Controls & Delegated Authority**  
**Effective: January 2024**

## Purpose

This document defines spending authority limits and approval requirements for various expense categories to ensure appropriate financial controls while enabling efficient business operations.

## General Principles

### Approval Authority
- Authority tied to role level, not individual
- Cannot approve own expenses (except CEO with Board oversight)
- Must stay within approved budget
- Unusual or questionable expenses require escalation regardless of amount
- Authority may be delegated temporarily (e.g., during absence)

### Budget Impact
- **Within Budget:** Use authority matrix for approvals
- **Over Budget:** Requires next level approval + budget amendment
- **No Budget:** Requires CFO approval regardless of amount

### Conflict of Interest
- Cannot approve expenses where personal interest exists
- Related party transactions require CFO approval
- Disclose relationships that may appear as conflicts
