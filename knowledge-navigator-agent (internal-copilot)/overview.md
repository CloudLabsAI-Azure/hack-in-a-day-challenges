# Knowledge Navigator Agent (Internal Copilot) – Hack in a Day

Welcome to the Knowledge Navigator Agent (Internal Copilot) Hack in a Day! Today, you'll learn how to build an AI-powered internal knowledge assistant that helps employees search and access internal documents across different departments. Through this hands-on experience, you'll create a copilot that provides answers with proper citations and can trigger helpful actions automatically.

## Introduction

Your mission is to build a **Knowledge Navigator Agent** that helps employees quickly find information from HR, Finance, IT, and Procurement departments. Using Microsoft Copilot Studio's no-code platform, you'll create a conversational AI assistant that searches through department policies and procedures, provides accurate answers with document sources, and can send summaries or create tickets when needed.

The copilot will serve as a centralized knowledge hub for employees, capable of answering questions about leave policies, procurement requests, travel reimbursements, and IT procedures – with proper citations showing exactly where the information came from. You'll also integrate actions using Power Automate to email documents, create support tickets, and send summaries automatically.

## Key Tools / Services

In this lab, you will primarily work with:

- **Microsoft Copilot Studio** - No-code platform for building conversational AI
- **Generative AI with Citations** - For answering questions with document sources
- **Power Automate** - For creating flows to email documents and create tickets
- **Microsoft Teams** - For receiving summaries and notifications
- **Microsoft 365** - For authentication and integration across the platform

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Create and configure an internal knowledge copilot in Microsoft Copilot Studio
- Upload and organize knowledge base documents from multiple departments
- Design conversational topics grouped by department functions
- Enable citation-based answers that show document sources
- Configure trigger actions to email documents, create tickets, and send summaries
- Test and publish your knowledge navigator for employee use
- Implement best practices for enterprise knowledge management with AI

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hack in a day adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through five progressive stages that build a complete Internal Knowledge Navigator. Each challenge focuses on a key capability:

- **Challenge 1: Create Your Internal Knowledge Copilot** – Set up Copilot Studio and create your first copilot with basic configuration
- **Challenge 2: Upload Department Documents** – Add policies and process documents from HR, Finance, IT, and Procurement departments
- **Challenge 3: Design Department Topics** – Build conversational topics grouped by department (Leave policy, Procurement request, Travel reimbursement)
- **Challenge 4: Enable Citation Answers** – Configure AI to provide answers with document source citations
- **Challenge 5: Add Trigger Actions** – Integrate Power Automate to email documents, create tickets, or send summaries

Throughout each challenge, you'll:
- Build practical, real-world knowledge management capabilities
- Learn through hands-on configuration and testing
- See immediate results as you test each feature
- Create a production-ready internal knowledge assistant

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with creating a new copilot in Microsoft Copilot Studio and configuring its basic identity. You'll then upload comprehensive internal documentation from HR (leave policies, onboarding guides), Finance (expense policies, reimbursement procedures), IT (support guides, software access), and Procurement (purchase request procedures, vendor management).

Next, you'll design interactive conversational topics grouped by department that guide employees to the right information with dynamic questions and smart routing. You'll configure Generative AI with citations enabled to automatically provide answers that reference the exact document source, building trust and allowing employees to verify information.

Finally, you'll integrate Power Automate to trigger helpful actions such as emailing a specific policy document to an employee, creating a support ticket for complex requests, or sending a summary of the conversation to their manager. By the end of this hack in a day, you'll have a fully functional Knowledge Navigator that helps employees find information 10x faster across all departments.
