# Knowledge Navigator Agent (Internal Copilot) – Hack in a Day

Welcome to the Knowledge Navigator Agent (Internal Copilot) Hack in a Day! Today, you'll explore how to design and build an AI-powered internal copilot that can intelligently navigate enterprise knowledge. Through this hands-on experience, you'll create an agent that unifies search across Microsoft 365 and other data sources, reasons over retrieved content, and delivers contextual answers with proper citations.

## Introduction

Your mission is to build a **Knowledge Navigator Agent** that helps employees quickly find and understand information scattered across Teams, SharePoint, emails, and project tools. Using Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Search, and Microsoft Copilot Studio, your agent will index enterprise content, autonomously choose the right data sources to query, and generate grounded responses with references.

The solution will act as a reasoning layer on top of enterprise content. It will support conversational Q&A, summarize documents, and trigger contextual actions such as opening relevant files or sending recap messages—improving productivity and collaboration across the organization.

## Key Tools / Services

In this lab, you will primarily work with:

- Azure AI Foundry / Azure OpenAI  
- Azure AI Search  
- Microsoft Copilot Studio  
- Power Automate  
- Microsoft 365 data sources (Teams, SharePoint, emails, etc.)

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Learn and apply retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) patterns for enterprise search.  
- Implement data connectors and indexing pipelines using Azure AI Search.  
- Build reasoning layers and orchestration flows in Azure AI Foundry.  
- Integrate Copilot Studio to expose the Knowledge Navigator Agent via a user-friendly chat experience.  
- Enable contextual actions (open docs, send summaries) using Power Automate.

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hack in a day adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through four progressive stages that mirror a real-world internal knowledge copilot implementation. Each challenge focuses on a key capability of the Knowledge Navigator Agent:

- **Challenge 1: Foundation** – Set up core resources (AI Foundry, AI Search index, and sample M365 content).  
- **Challenge 2: Data Connectors & Indexing** – Configure connectors and build a unified search index across internal data sources.  
- **Challenge 3: Reasoning & RAG** – Implement retrieval-augmented generation and reasoning workflows in Azure AI Foundry.  
- **Challenge 4: Copilot Experience & Actions** – Integrate with Copilot Studio and Power Automate for conversational UX and contextual actions.

Throughout each challenge, you'll:
- Analyze how employees search and consume information today.  
- Strategize and design RAG-based patterns that balance relevance, grounding, and citations.  
- Leverage your Microsoft cloud environment to deploy, integrate, and test the Knowledge Navigator Agent.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with setting up the necessary Azure AI and search resources, along with representative enterprise content samples (such as documents, wiki pages, and project notes). You’ll then configure Azure AI Search to index these sources and expose a unified search layer.

Next, you will implement a RAG pipeline using Azure AI Foundry that autonomously selects the best data sources, retrieves relevant content, and produces grounded answers with citations. Finally, you’ll integrate the agent into Microsoft Copilot Studio for a chat-based experience and add contextual actions using Power Automate—such as opening documents or sending summaries to Teams.

By the end of this hack in a day, you'll have a working **Knowledge Navigator Agent (Internal Copilot)** capable of conversational Q&A, contextual summarization, and action launching across enterprise data sources.
