# AI-Powered B2B Account Intelligence Assistant

Welcome to the AI-Powered B2B Account Intelligence Hack in a Day!  
In this lab, you will build an AI-driven sales intelligence assistant that aggregates account-level insights and delivers contextual briefings for sales teams before customer meetings.

Using Microsoft Foundry (Azure OpenAI), Azure AI Search, Azure Blob Storage, and Streamlit, you will design an end-to-end account intelligence solution that helps sales teams engage customers with better context, clarity, and confidence.

## Scenario

Sales teams often rely on fragmented data sources such as CRM notes, news articles, financial reports, and social sentiment to understand their customer accounts. Gathering and synthesizing this information manually is inefficient and often incomplete, leading to missed opportunities and reactive conversations.

To solve this problem, the organization decides to build a **B2B Account Intelligence Assistant**. The AI agent aggregates synthetic CRM data, news updates, financial signals, and sentiment summaries into a unified knowledge base. Before meetings, sales representatives can ask questions like:

- “What recent changes happened at this account?”
- “Are there any risks or upsell opportunities?”
- “Summarize key talking points for today’s meeting”

The AI delivers concise, actionable briefings tailored to each account.

## Introduction

Your mission is to build a **Sales Account Intelligence Assistant** powered by Generative AI and RAG. The solution stores account intelligence documents in Azure Blob Storage, indexes them using Azure AI Search, and connects them to a Foundry-based AI agent. A Streamlit UI allows sales teams to query account insights conversationally.

This lab demonstrates how AI can transform B2B sales engagement by turning scattered data into clear, actionable intelligence.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Store account intelligence documents in Azure Blob Storage  
- Index unstructured business data using Azure AI Search  
- Deploy Foundry LLM and embedding models  
- Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for sales intelligence  
- Generate contextual account briefings using GenAI prompts  
- Build a Streamlit-based chat interface for sales users  

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based
