# IT Support Copilot with Microsoft Copilot Studio

Welcome to the IT Support Copilot Hack in a Day! Today, you'll learn how to build an intelligent, conversational AI assistant that helps employees resolve common IT support issues instantly. Through this hands-on experience, you'll create a copilot that answers questions from knowledge base documents, guides users through troubleshooting steps, and automatically sends resolution summaries to your IT team.

## Sceanrio

A growing organization is overwhelmed with recurring IT support tickets such as password resets, VPN issues, slow devices, and printer problems. The helpdesk team is spending most of its time solving repeat requests instead of focusing on critical incidents and escalations. To reduce ticket volume and provide 24/7 assistance, the company decides to build an IT Support Copilot that can answer support questions using IT knowledge base documents, guide users through troubleshooting steps, and notify the IT team when intervention is required. This ensures faster issue resolution, happier employees, and reduced workload on IT support staff.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create an IT Support Copilot that dramatically reduces the workload on your helpdesk by handling the most common support requests: password resets, VPN connection issues, slow laptop complaints, and printer problems. Using Microsoft Copilot Studio's no-code platform, you'll build a conversational AI that leverages generative AI to provide accurate, helpful responses based on your organization's IT support documentation.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Create and configure a copilot from scratch in Microsoft Copilot Studio
- Upload and manage knowledge base documents for AI-powered question answering
- Design conversational topics with dynamic branching logic and question flows
- Configure Generative AI capabilities to handle unexpected questions using document context
- Integrate Power Automate flows for sending notifications and automating workflows
- Test, iterate, and publish your copilot for real-world use
- Implement best practices for conversational AI design and user experience

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hack in a day adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through five progressive stages that build a complete IT Support Copilot. Each challenge focuses on a key capability:

- **Challenge 1: Create Your IT Support Copilot** – Set up Copilot Studio and create your first copilot with basic configuration
- **Challenge 2: Upload Knowledge Base Documents** – Add IT support SOPs and FAQs to enable document-based answers
- **Challenge 3: Design Conversational Topics** – Build interactive troubleshooting flows for common issues (slow laptop, VPN, printer)
- **Challenge 4: Add Generative AI Fallback** – Configure AI to handle unknown questions by searching your knowledge base
- **Challenge 5: Send Resolution Summaries** – Integrate Power Automate to send notifications via Teams or email

Throughout each challenge, you'll:
- Build practical, real-world copilot capabilities
- Learn through hands-on configuration and testing
- See immediate results as you test each feature
- Create a production-ready IT support solution

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with creating a new copilot in Microsoft Copilot Studio and configuring its basic identity. You'll then upload comprehensive IT support documentation (password reset procedures, VPN troubleshooting guides, slow laptop solutions, and printer issue resolution) to serve as the copilot's knowledge base.

Next, you'll design three interactive conversational topics that guide users through common IT issues with dynamic questions and branching logic. You'll configure Generative AI to automatically handle questions that don't match your predefined topics by intelligently searching and summarizing information from your uploaded documents.

Finally, you'll integrate Power Automate to automatically send resolution summaries to your IT support team via Microsoft Teams or email whenever an issue is resolved. By the end of this hack in a day, you'll have a fully functional IT Support Copilot that can handle dozens of common support requests, reducing your helpdesk workload by an estimated 40-50%.
