# Autonomous IT Troubleshooting Agent – Hack in a Day

Welcome to the Autonomous IT Troubleshooting Agent Hack in a Day! Today, you'll explore how to design and build an AI-powered agent that can automatically diagnose and resolve common IT incidents. Through this hands-on experience, you'll create an agent that analyzes system signals, invokes tools, and decides when to act or escalate – all without constant human intervention.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create an autonomous IT troubleshooting agent that reduces manual effort for repetitive support issues such as CPU overuse, service restarts, and user access problems. Using an LLM-powered reasoning loop (for example, Azure OpenAI or Azure AI Foundry), your agent will analyze incident details, interpret logs, query knowledge bases, and trigger remediation workflows via Power Automate or APIs (such as Azure Functions).

The solution will act as an intelligent assistant for IT operations teams, capable of handling common incidents end-to-end – from understanding the problem, to selecting the right action, to escalating complex or risky cases to human engineers via Microsoft Teams.

## Key Tools / Services

In this lab, you will primarily work with:

- Azure AI Foundry / Azure OpenAI
- Power Automate
- Microsoft Teams
- Microsoft Dataverse
- Azure (for APIs / Functions and basic infrastructure integration)

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Understand agent loops, planning, and self-correction in agentic architectures.
- Implement tool invocation using Power Automate flows or REST APIs (e.g., Azure Functions).
- Design basic prompt-based reasoning, guardrails, and escalation logic for IT incidents.
- Configure Copilot Studio or Azure AI Foundry to host and surface the troubleshooting agent.
- Integrate the agent with Microsoft Teams for notifications and hand-off to human operators.

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hack in a day adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through four progressive stages that mirror a real-world IT operations scenario. Each challenge focuses on a key capability of the Autonomous IT Troubleshooting Agent:

- **Challenge 1: Foundation** – Set up the environment, core resources, and knowledge base needed for the agent.
- **Challenge 2: Reasoning & Diagnosis** – Design the LLM prompt flow and reasoning loop to interpret incidents and logs.
- **Challenge 3: Tools & Actions** – Connect the agent to tools such as Power Automate flows, Dataverse, and Azure APIs for remediation.
- **Challenge 4: Orchestration & Escalation** – Integrate with Microsoft Teams, implement escalation logic, and validate end-to-end flows.

Throughout each challenge, you'll:
- Analyze common IT incidents and operational requirements.
- Strategize and design an agentic solution that can plan, act, and self-correct.
- Leverage your Microsoft cloud environment to deploy, integrate, and test the troubleshooting agent.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with setting up the necessary Azure AI and Power Platform resources, along with a basic knowledge base for IT troubleshooting patterns. You'll then design an agent reasoning loop that can interpret issue descriptions and logs, classify incident types, and decide on next actions.

Next, you'll extend the solution by wiring the agent to remediation tools using Power Automate, Dataverse, and APIs (for example, restarting a service or resetting a user account). Finally, you'll integrate the agent with Microsoft Teams for notifications and human hand-off, and implement escalation paths for complex or high-risk incidents.

By the end of this hack in a day, you'll have a working autonomous IT troubleshooting agent capable of diagnosing and resolving simple incidents, triggering automated workflows, and escalating to humans when necessary.
