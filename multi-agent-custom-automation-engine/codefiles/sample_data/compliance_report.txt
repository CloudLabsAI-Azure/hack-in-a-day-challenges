FINDINGS:

Finding 1: CRITICAL RISK
Title: Unencrypted PII in Staging Environment

Personally Identifiable Information (PII), including customer names, email
addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses. The staging environment
uses production data copies without anonymization.

Responsible Team: IT Security - Lead: Kevin O'Brien

Finding 2: HIGH RISK
Title: Insufficient Access Log Retention
Description: Access logs for customer data systems are retained for only 60 days.
Company policy and SOC 2 requirements mandate 180-day retention. Previous audit
(AUD-2025-Q2-009) flagged this issue; it remains unresolved.
Affected Systems: All customer-facing systems
Impact: Inability to investigate historical access patterns; SOC 2 non-compliance
Remediation Deadline: March 1, 2026 (45 days)
Responsible Team: IT Operations - Lead: Lisa Tran

Remediation Deadline: January 31, 2026 (immediate)

Finding 4: LOW RISK
Title: Missing Data Processing Agreements
Description: 2 out of 8 third-party data processors lack signed Data Processing
Agreements (DPAs). Both vendors were onboarded in Q3 2025. Contracts exist but
DPA addendums were not executed.
Vendors: CloudMetrics Analytics, DataSync Pro
Impact: GDPR non-compliance for EU customer data
Remediation Deadline: February 28, 2026

4. Execute DPA agreements with CloudMetrics and DataSync within 30 days
5. Schedule quarterly access reviews for all customer data systems
6. Implement data classification labeling across all repositories
