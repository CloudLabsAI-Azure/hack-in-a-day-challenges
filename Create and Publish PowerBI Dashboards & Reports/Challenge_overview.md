# Create and Publish Power BI Dashboards & Reports (Dashboard-in-a-Day)

Welcome to the Copilot Hackathon! Today, you'll explore the power of data storytelling by building and publishing a Power BI report and dashboard end-to-end. You’ll enhance a pre-created report, apply design best practices, and publish it to the Power BI Service—then construct an executive-ready dashboard.

## Introduction

Your quest is to create a compelling analytics experience using Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service. Starting from a pre-built report, you’ll apply conditional formatting, add branding (logos/themes), import custom visuals, and create bookmarks for narrative flow. You’ll then publish the report to the Service, pin key visuals to a dashboard, and use Q&A/Insights to surface quick findings for stakeholders.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Set up and sign in to Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service in the lab environment.
- Enhance a pre-built report with **conditional formatting**, **custom visuals**, and **custom themes**.
- Apply **branding** (logos) and configure **mobile layout** and **selection** panes for clean composition.
- Use **bookmarks** to craft an interactive story across report pages.
- Publish reports to **Power BI Service**, manage **workspaces**, and configure basic **tenant settings** when required.
- Build an executive **dashboard** by **pinning visuals**, organizing tiles, and leveraging **Q&A** and **Quick Insights**.

## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based

This hackathon adopts a challenge-based format, offering you a hands-on way to learn by solving a practical problem. The challenge includes one or more objectives designed to test and deepen your Power BI skills.

- Analyzing the problem statement.
- Strategizing an approach to produce an executive-ready dashboard.
- Leveraging the provided lab environment, Power BI Desktop, and Power BI Service.

## Challenge Overview

Begin your journey in **Power BI Desktop** with a pre-created report. Apply **conditional formatting** to highlight outliers, add **logos** for branding, and import **custom visuals** to improve data expression. Unify the look and feel with a **custom theme**, and create **bookmarks** to guide stakeholders through key insights.

Next, **publish** the report to **Power BI Service** and organize it in a workspace. From there, **pin** critical visuals to a new **dashboard**, arrange tiles for readability, and use **Q&A** and **Quick Insights** to accelerate discovery. Optionally, configure **alerts** for threshold-based monitoring of key metrics. By the end, you’ll have a polished dashboard and shared report ready for collaboration.

## Happy Hacking!!
