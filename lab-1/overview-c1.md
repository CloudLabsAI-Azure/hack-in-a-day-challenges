## Overview
In this lab, participants will learn how to build an **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)** solution for finance teams using **Azure AI Document Intelligence**.  
You will automate the extraction of data from invoices, validate it against simple business rules, and store structured results for reporting or integration.

The goal is to experience how AI-driven document automation can reduce manual data entry, minimize errors, and accelerate financial processing.

## Problem Statement

Finance teams spend large amounts of time on manual capture, validation and reconciliation of invoice and payment documents. Typical pain points include: slow invoice turnaround, human errors when transcribing fields (PO number, line-items, totals), inconsistent formats across vendors, and difficult audit trails. These manual processes cause late payments, lost early-payment discounts, and slow month-end closes.

## Solution Overview

Provide a lightweight, production-style prototype that automates end-to-end invoice ingestion, extraction, validation and routing using modern IDP and serverless services. The accelerator demonstrates how to: ingest mixed-format invoices (PDFs, scanned images, emails), extract structured data (supplier, invoice number, dates, line items, totals), validate against simple business rules (PO match, tax rounding), and route results to downstream systems (save to storage / produce a CSV / queue for human review). The lab uses Azure AI Document Intelligence (Form Recognizer lineage), serverless glue (Functions/Logic Apps)  to show how finance teams cut processing time and errors. Azure’s Document Intelligence provides prebuilt and custom model options to speed extraction and maintain accuracy.

## Learning Objectives

**Description:**  
By the end of this lab, you will learn:

- Understand Document Intelligence concepts: prebuilt vs custom models, layout/read/table extraction. 
- Ingest different document types (PDF, scanned images) into a processing pipeline.
- Train or configure a custom extraction model (if needed) and use prebuilt invoice models for quick wins. 
- Implement basic validation/business rules (PO matching, totals check) and human-in-the-loop review.
- Export structured results to storage / CSV / downstream API and demonstrate a simple reconciliation UI or automated flagging.
- Discuss accuracy, monitoring, and resource cleanup considerations for short demo deployments.

## Challenges Overview

- **Challenge 01: Create Azure AI Document Intelligence Resource**  
Set up the Azure AI Document Intelligence service within your subscription. This challenge focuses on deploying the foundational resource required to enable intelligent document processing across your finance workflows.

- **Challenge 02: Extract Data Using the Prebuilt Invoice Model**  
Leverage the Prebuilt Invoice Model in Document Intelligence Studio to automatically extract structured data such as vendor details, invoice numbers, and totals from uploaded PDF invoices.

- **Challenge 03: Validate Extracted Invoice Data**  
Review and verify the accuracy of the extracted invoice data against key business rules. Ensure totals match calculations and mandatory fields are correctly captured before data storage.

- **Challenge 04: Store Extracted Results in Azure Storage**  
Securely store validated invoice data in Azure Blob Storage for audit, reporting, and downstream integration. Learn to manage containers and handle JSON output securely through the Azure Portal.

- **Challenge 05: Visualize Extracted Invoice Summary**  
Transform the extracted invoice data into actionable insights. Use Power BI or Excel to visualize total spending, vendor distribution, and invoice trends for better financial decision-making.

- **Challenge 06: Clean Up Resources**  
Delete all deployed Azure resources to prevent unnecessary costs and ensure a clean environment post-lab completion. This step finalizes your Intelligent Document Processing deployment workflow.
