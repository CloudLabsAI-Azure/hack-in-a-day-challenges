   - **Public Access Level:** *Private (no anonymous access)*  
4. Return to **Document Intelligence Studio** and click **Download Results** to save the invoice JSON output.  
5. In your container, click **Upload** → select the downloaded JSON file → click **Upload**.  
6. Refresh the container list to verify the uploaded file appears.
