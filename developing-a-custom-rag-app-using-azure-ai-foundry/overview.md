# Developing a Custom RAG App Using Azure AI Foundry

Welcome to the Custom RAG Application Hack in a Day! Today, you'll explore the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation by building a comprehensive AI application using Azure AI Foundry. Through this hands-on experience, you'll learn how to design intelligent systems that can retrieve relevant information from knowledge sources and generate accurate, contextual responses using advanced AI models.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that transforms how organizations handle knowledge management and information retrieval. Leveraging Azure AI Foundry SDK, Azure AI Search, and advanced AI models, you'll design a solution that can intelligently index knowledge sources, retrieve relevant information, and generate accurate responses with observability and performance optimization.

This solution will act as a comprehensive intelligent knowledge platform integrating document processing, semantic search, AI-driven response generation, and performance monitoring to deliver faster, smarter, and more efficient information retrieval experiences for users and developers alike.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Set up Azure AI Foundry projects and deploy advanced AI models for RAG applications.
- Implement Azure AI Search for intelligent document indexing and semantic retrieval.
- Build comprehensive RAG pipelines integrating knowledge retrieval and response generation.
- Configure observability and telemetry using OpenTelemetry and Azure Monitor for performance tracking.
- Evaluate and optimize RAG application performance using Azure AI evaluation frameworks.

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hack in a day adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through three progressive stages that mirror a real-world RAG application implementation. Each challenge focuses on a key capability of the Custom RAG Solution:

- **Challenge 1: Foundation & Intelligence** - Integrate observability mechanisms and build AI-driven fitness assistants using advanced frameworks.
- **Challenge 2: Multi-Agent Systems** - Implement Semantic Kernel agents and multi-agent RAG systems using Autogen for complex reasoning.
- **Challenge 3: Complete RAG Implementation** - Develop end-to-end custom RAG applications with full Azure AI Foundry integration and optimization.

Throughout each challenge, you'll:
- Analyze knowledge management requirements and RAG architecture patterns.
- Strategize and design scalable AI-driven information retrieval solutions.
- Leverage Azure AI Foundry to implement, monitor, and optimize intelligent RAG applications.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with implementing observability and tracing mechanisms for AI agent monitoring. You'll then build multi-agent RAG systems using advanced frameworks like Semantic Kernel and Autogen. Finally, you'll create a complete custom RAG application with full Azure AI Foundry integration, including model deployment, knowledge indexing, and performance evaluation.

By the end of this hack in a day, you'll have a fully functional Custom RAG Application capable of intelligent knowledge retrieval, contextual response generation, multi-agent reasoning, and comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization.
