# Customer Support Conversation Summarization with Azure OpenAI

Welcome to the Copilot Hackathon! Today, you’ll streamline customer service operations by building an AI-powered **conversation summarization** workflow. You’ll generate concise summaries from chat transcripts and call recordings using **Azure OpenAI**, **Azure AI Language Studio**, and **Azure AI Speech Studio**—so agents and leaders can grasp the “what, why, and outcome” in seconds.

## Introduction

Your quest is to create an end-to-end summarization pipeline for customer–agent interactions. You’ll work with text transcripts and audio calls, apply **LLM-based summarization**, and—where helpful—layer in **sentiment**, **key phrases**, and **topics**. By the end, you’ll have a repeatable approach that turns long conversations into crisp insights suitable for handoffs, QA, and reporting.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- **Provision Azure AI services** needed for summarization (Azure OpenAI, AI Language, and AI Speech).
- Use **Azure AI Language Studio** to summarize text-based conversations and extract key insights.
- Use **Azure AI Speech Studio** to **transcribe** audio calls and generate **call summaries**.
- (Optional) Apply **sentiment analysis** and **key phrase extraction** to enrich summaries.
- Validate outputs against business-friendly criteria (issue, action, resolution) and capture results for downstream workflows.

## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based

This hackathon follows a challenge-based format so you learn by solving a practical problem:

- Analyze the customer-support scenario and define the desired summary format.
- Strategize the flow for text and audio inputs across Azure AI services.
- Leverage the provided lab environment, datasets, and Azure tools to implement and validate the pipeline.

## Challenge Overview

Begin by deploying the required Azure resources. In **Azure AI Language Studio**, upload sample **text transcripts** and run summarization to produce concise notes that capture customer **issue**, agent **actions**, and **resolution**. Next, use **Azure AI Speech Studio** to **transcribe audio** recordings and apply **conversation summarization** on the resulting text. Optionally, enhance results with **sentiment** and **key phrases** for quicker triage and reporting.

By the end of the challenge, you’ll have a working summarization workflow for both text and audio conversations that can be adapted for real support operations.

## Happy Hacking!!
