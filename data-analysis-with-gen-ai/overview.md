# Manufacturing – Data Analysis with Generative AI (GenAI)
*Apply generative AI to analyze, summarize, and interpret manufacturing data for actionable insights.*

**Duration:** 6 hours  
  
**Tags:** `Manufacturing`, `Generative AI`, `Data Analytics`, `Microsoft Foundry`, `Industry 4.0`

## Overview

In this lab, participants will learn how to use **Generative AI** to analyze manufacturing operational data and automatically generate insights and recommendations.  
You’ll ingest a synthetic manufacturing dataset, summarize trends, detect anomalies, and build a simple insights dashboard using Microsoft Foundry (LLM capabilities) and data-analysis tools.

The goal is to demonstrate how GenAI can turn raw machine and sensor logs into meaningful, human-readable narratives that accelerate decision-making on the factory floor.

## Problem Statement

Manufacturers generate massive volumes of data from production lines, sensors, machines, quality-inspections, supply-chain logs, and maintenance records. Yet many operations teams struggle to gain meaningful insights quickly: patterns remain hidden, downtime causes are reactive rather than predictive, data sits in silos, and generating actionable reports takes too long. This slows responsiveness, drives up waste, and limits the ability to proactively optimize manufacturing throughput and quality.

## Solution Overview

Provide a streamlined 6-hour prototype environment where participants use generative AI tools (large language models + analytics) to ingest, analyse, and summarise manufacturing operational data. The accelerator will show how to: connect to production/sensor logs, feed into a generative-AI workflow (e.g., prompt + retrieval + summarisation + insight generation), surface root-cause suggestions, produce dashboards and natural-language commentary for operations teams, and deliver a “co-pilot” interface for manufacturing data. By combining data analytics + GenAI, the lab enables teams to move from raw machine/sensor data to meaningful insights and recommendations in a short time.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to ingest and prepare manufacturing operational data (machine logs, sensor data) for AI analysis.
- Deploy and configure Microsoft Foundry with LLM capabilities (gpt-4.1-mini) and embedding models for semantic search.
- Create Azure AI Search indexes to enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios with manufacturing data.
- Use generative AI prompts to extract insights, detect patterns, and generate natural-language summaries from structured data.
- Build a chat-style interface (Streamlit) to interact with data through conversational queries.
- Recognize challenges: prompt engineering, data quality, hallucination risks, and best practices for GenAI in manufacturing contexts.

## Challenges Overview

- **Challenge 01: Create and Review the Sample Manufacturing Dataset**  
Prepare the provided synthetic dataset, upload it to Azure Storage, and explore its structure. This challenge introduces the data you’ll analyze with GenAI.

- **Challenge 02: Deploy Microsoft Foundry**  
Provision a Microsoft Foundry resource and configure a project with access to LLM capabilities (for example `gpt-4.1-mini`) for generative data summarization.

- **Challenge 03: Create Azure AI Search Resource and Import Manufacturing Data:**
In this challenge, you’ll create an **Azure AI Search** service and import your manufacturing dataset into an index.  

- **Challenge 04: Analyze Data Using GenAI Prompts**  
Use Microsoft Foundry Studio or a notebook to prompt the deployed LLM for key insights and pattern detection from the dataset.

- **Challenge 05: Add a Chat-Style Interface for Insights**  
Create a simple chat UI (Streamlit / web form) to interact with your data and ask questions such as “Which machine had the most downtime this week?”
