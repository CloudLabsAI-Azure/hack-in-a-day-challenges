# Hands-on with Azure AI Foundry and Agent Frameworks

Welcome to the Azure AI Foundry and Agent Frameworks Hack in a Day! Today, you'll explore the power of intelligent agent development by building comprehensive AI solutions using Azure AI Foundry and advanced agent frameworks. Through this hands-on experience, you'll learn how to design, develop, and deploy sophisticated AI agents that can handle complex reasoning, multi-turn conversations, and specialized tasks.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create advanced AI-driven solutions that demonstrate the full capabilities of Azure AI Foundry and modern agent frameworks. Leveraging Azure AI Foundry, Semantic Kernel, Autogen, and various specialized tools, you'll design intelligent agents that can perform complex reasoning, handle multi-agent orchestration, and deliver specialized experiences for health, fitness, and enterprise applications.

This solution will act as a comprehensive AI agent development platform integrating foundational model capabilities, specialized tooling, observability monitoring, and multi-agent coordination to deliver faster, smarter, and more efficient AI-driven experiences for users and developers alike.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Navigate and utilize Azure AI Foundry workspace for comprehensive AI agent development.
- Implement chat completions, embeddings, and RAG workflows for intelligent conversation systems.
- Develop specialized AI agents for health, fitness, and enterprise applications using advanced frameworks.
- Configure observability and monitoring using OpenTelemetry and Azure Monitor for agent performance tracking.
- Build multi-agent systems using Semantic Kernel and Autogen for complex reasoning and task orchestration.

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hack in a day adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through six progressive exercises that mirror real-world AI agent development scenarios. Each exercise focuses on key capabilities of Azure AI Foundry and Agent Frameworks:

- **Exercise 1: Foundation** - Explore Azure AI Foundry workspace and understand platform capabilities.
- **Exercise 2: Environment Setup** - Configure authentication, project clients, and service connections.
- **Exercise 3: Core Capabilities** - Implement chat completions, embeddings, and RAG workflows.
- **Exercise 4: Agent Development** - Build specialized AI agents with tools and multi-turn conversation capabilities.
- **Exercise 5: Observability** - Integrate monitoring and tracing for reliable AI agent operations.
- **Exercise 6: Advanced Systems** - Create multi-agent frameworks with Semantic Kernel and Autogen integration.

Throughout each exercise, you'll:
- Analyze AI agent requirements and architectural patterns.
- Strategize and design scalable intelligent agent solutions.
- Leverage Azure AI Foundry and agent frameworks to implement, monitor, and optimize AI systems.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with exploring Azure AI Foundry workspace and understanding its capabilities for AI development. You'll then configure authentication and project environments for hands-on development. Next, you'll implement core AI capabilities including chat completions and RAG workflows. You'll continue by building specialized AI agents with advanced tooling, then integrate observability for production readiness. Finally, you'll create sophisticated multi-agent systems for complex reasoning and collaboration.

By the end of this hack in a day, you'll have comprehensive experience with Azure AI Foundry and Agent Frameworks, capable of building production-ready AI agents, implementing multi-agent orchestration, and deploying intelligent solutions with full observability and monitoring.
