# Build a Customer Care Copilot in a Day

Welcome to the Customer Care Copilot Hack in a Day! Today, you'll explore the power of AI-driven customer service by building an intelligent copilot that handles customer inquiries, complaints, and service requests automatically. Through this hands-on experience, you'll learn how to design a conversational AI system using Microsoft Copilot Studio that integrates with Freshdesk for automated ticket creation.

## Scenario

Contoso is experiencing a dramatic increase in customer inquiries across email, chat, and social channels, mainly around order tracking, delayed deliveries, product returns, and service complaints. Support agents are overwhelmed by repeated questions, causing longer wait times and reduced customer satisfaction. To improve responsiveness and reduce manual workload, the company has decided to build a Customer Care Copilot that can assist customers conversationally, collect required details, and automatically create support tickets in Freshdesk when escalation is required. This solution ensures fast, consistent, and proactive customer service without overloading support teams.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create a customer care copilot that transforms how organizations handle customer support. Leveraging Microsoft Copilot Studio's no-code platform and Freshdesk integration, you'll design an intelligent agent that can automatically assist customers with order tracking, product returns, delivery delays, and service complaints, escalating to human support when needed.

This solution will act as a comprehensive customer care automation platform integrating conversational AI, generative topic creation, external API integration with Freshdesk, and automated ticket management to deliver faster, smarter, and more efficient customer service experiences.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Create and configure a Customer Care Copilot from scratch in Microsoft Copilot Studio
- Set up Freshdesk account and obtain API credentials for external integration
- Create agent flows within Copilot Studio to integrate with Freshdesk API
- Use generative AI to create conversational topics with customer service workflows
- Map topic variables to flow inputs for dynamic ticket creation with proper subject lines and descriptions
- Test end-to-end integration from copilot to Freshdesk ticket creation
- Deploy your copilot to Microsoft Teams for organization-wide access
- Implement best practices for customer service automation and user experience

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hack in a day adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through six progressive stages that build a complete Customer Care Copilot. Each challenge focuses on a key capability:

- **Challenge 1: Create Customer Care Copilot in Copilot Studio** – Set up Copilot Studio, create your Customer Care Copilot, and configure basic settings
- **Challenge 2: Setup Freshdesk & Get API Credentials** – Activate Freshdesk free trial, configure account, and obtain API Key and Account URL for integration
- **Challenge 3: Create CustomerServiceFlow** – Build an agent flow within Copilot Studio that connects to Freshdesk API for automated ticket creation
- **Challenge 4: Create Topics Using Generative AI** – Use AI to generate 4 conversational topics (OrderTrackingAssistance, ProductReturnProcessing, DeliveryDelayManagement, ServiceQualityComplaintHandling) and connect them to CustomerServiceFlow
- **Challenge 5: Test Your Customer Care Copilot End-to-End** – Thoroughly test all topics, verify Freshdesk integration, and validate ticket creation
- **Challenge 6: Publish Your Copilot to Microsoft Teams** – Deploy copilot to Teams for organization-wide access and test complete customer experience

Throughout each challenge, you'll:
- Build practical, real-world customer service automation capabilities
- Learn through hands-on configuration with Copilot Studio and Freshdesk
- See immediate results as tickets are created in Freshdesk
- Create a production-ready customer care solution with external API integration

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with creating a new Customer Care Copilot in Microsoft Copilot Studio and configuring basic settings. You'll then set up a Freshdesk account and obtain the API credentials needed for external integration.

Next, you'll create an agent flow within Copilot Studio (not external Power Automate) that connects to the Freshdesk API for automated ticket creation. You'll use generative AI to create four interactive conversational topics: OrderTrackingAssistance (order tracking and delivery status), ProductReturnProcessing (return and exchange requests), DeliveryDelayManagement (delayed delivery handling), and ServiceQualityComplaintHandling (complaint escalation). Each topic will capture customer information and escalate to Freshdesk ticket creation when needed.

Finally, you'll thoroughly test the complete solution and deploy it to Microsoft Teams for organization-wide access. By the end of this hack in a day, you'll have a fully functional Customer Care Copilot integrated with Freshdesk that can handle customer service requests and create support tickets automatically.
