# Build a Proactive Customer Care Agent in a Day

Welcome to the Proactive Customer Care Agent Hack in a Day! Today, you'll explore the power of AI-driven customer service by building an intelligent agent that proactively identifies and resolves customer issues before they escalate. Through this hands-on experience, you'll learn how to design an autonomous system that can monitor customer feedback, analyze sentiment, and trigger intelligent interventions for superior customer experience.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create a proactive customer care system that transforms how organizations handle customer support. Leveraging Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Language, Azure OpenAI, and Power Automate, you'll design an intelligent agent that can automatically monitor incoming feedback and CRM data, detect negative sentiment patterns, and trigger proactive interventions before problems become critical escalations.

This solution will act as a comprehensive customer care intelligence platform integrating sentiment analysis, multi-step reasoning workflows, automated alerting, and preventive action recommendations to deliver faster, smarter, and more efficient customer service experiences for support teams and customers alike.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Set up Azure AI Foundry and Azure AI Language services for intelligent orchestration and sentiment analysis.
- Integrate multiple customer feedback channels and CRM data sources into a unified monitoring pipeline.
- Build multi-step reasoning workflows that autonomously classify issues and determine appropriate interventions.
- Implement automated alert systems with Microsoft Teams integration for real-time team collaboration.
- Configure proactive compensation workflows and escalation logic for autonomous customer care.
- Generate daily summaries with actionable insights and preventive action recommendations.

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hack in a day adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through four progressive stages that mirror a real-world proactive customer care implementation. Each challenge focuses on a key capability of the Proactive Customer Care Agent:

- **Challenge 1: Foundation** - Set up Azure AI Foundry and Language Services for sentiment analysis and intelligent orchestration.
- **Challenge 2: Data Integration** - Connect multiple feedback sources and CRM data to create a unified monitoring pipeline.
- **Challenge 3: Intelligence Layer** - Build sentiment analysis with multi-step reasoning workflows for proactive issue detection.
- **Challenge 4: Automation & Response** - Implement automated alerts, compensation workflows, and Teams integration for proactive interventions.

Throughout each challenge, you'll:
- Analyze customer feedback patterns and proactive care requirements.
- Strategize and design scalable AI-driven customer service solutions.
- Leverage your Azure environment to deploy, integrate, and test intelligent agent workflows.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with setting up Azure AI Foundry and Azure AI Language services for intelligent orchestration and sentiment analysis. You'll then implement data ingestion from multiple feedback channels and CRM systems. Next, you'll build the intelligence layer with sentiment analysis and multi-step reasoning for autonomous issue detection. Finally, you'll create automated response workflows with Microsoft Teams integration, proactive compensation logic, and daily summary generation.

By the end of this hack in a day, you'll have a fully functional Proactive Customer Care Agent capable of autonomous feedback monitoring, sentiment analysis, intelligent decision-making, automated interventions, and team collaboration.
