# Financial Insight & Risk Advisor Agent – Hack in a Day

Welcome to the Financial Insight & Risk Advisor Agent Hack in a Day! Today, you'll explore how to design and build an AI-powered agent that automatically analyzes financial reports, summarizes key trends, and flags potential risks or anomalies. Through this hands-on experience, you'll create an agent that reduces manual review time while improving the consistency and transparency of financial insight generation.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create an autonomous financial risk advisor agent that helps finance leaders move from reactive reporting to proactive, insight-driven decision making. Using Azure AI Foundry and Azure OpenAI, your agent will ingest structured and unstructured financial documents (such as PDFs and Excel files) via Azure Document Intelligence, extract key metrics, apply reasoning prompts to detect anomalies, and generate executive-ready summaries.

The solution will act as an intelligent assistant for finance teams, capable of combining document understanding, anomaly detection, and natural-language explanations. It will decide when to trigger alerts or generate summaries for CFO review, helping organizations catch early warning signals before they become critical issues.

## Key Tools / Services

In this lab, you will primarily work with:

- Azure AI Foundry / Azure OpenAI
- Azure Document Intelligence
- Power Automate
- Power BI
- Azure (for storage, APIs, and integration)

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Use Azure AI Foundry to chain document ingestion → reasoning → alerting.
- Build agents that evaluate confidence and act autonomously on financial insights.
- Create natural-language summaries and recommendations for finance stakeholders.
- Implement explainability and traceability in AI-generated outputs.

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hack in a day adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through four progressive stages that mirror a real-world financial analytics workflow. Each challenge focuses on a key capability of the Financial Insight & Risk Advisor Agent:

- **Challenge 1: Foundation** – Set up the environment, data storage, and financial document samples.
- **Challenge 2: Document Intelligence** – Ingest and extract data from financial reports using Azure Document Intelligence.
- **Challenge 3: Reasoning & Risk Analysis** – Use Azure AI Foundry to summarize trends and detect anomalies with LLM-based reasoning.
- **Challenge 4: Visualization & Alerting** – Build Power BI views, configure alerts via Power Automate, and surface CFO-ready summaries.

Throughout each challenge, you'll:
- Analyze financial reporting requirements and risk scenarios.
- Strategize and design an agentic solution that can reason over extracted data.
- Leverage your Microsoft cloud environment to deploy, integrate, and test the financial risk advisor agent.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with setting up the necessary Azure and AI resources, along with a sample financial dataset that simulates quarterly or monthly reports. You’ll then implement document ingestion and extraction workflows using Azure Document Intelligence to convert PDFs and spreadsheets into structured data.

Next, you'll orchestrate LLM-based reasoning in Azure AI Foundry to summarize trends, calculate key ratios, and identify anomalies or risk indicators. Finally, you'll visualize insights in Power BI, implement automated alerts via Power Automate, and generate CFO-ready summaries that highlight key findings and explain model decisions.

By the end of this hack in a day, you'll have a working Financial Insight & Risk Advisor Agent capable of ingesting financial reports, generating risk-aware summaries, and triggering alerts for finance stakeholders.
