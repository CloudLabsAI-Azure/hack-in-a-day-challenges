# Financial Insight & Risk Advisor Agent

Welcome to the Financial Insight & Risk Advisor Agent Hack in a Day! Today, you’ll explore how AI can drive smarter financial decision-making by building an intelligent Copilot that assists finance teams in analyzing reports and identifying risks.

## Scenario

A fast-growing organization is struggling to manually review quarterly financial reports and detect early signs of revenue slowdown or cash flow pressure. Important performance risks are often discovered late because analysts spend too much time extracting numbers instead of interpreting them. To address this, the company wants to build a Financial Risk Advisor Copilot that can analyze uploaded reports, summarize trends, classify business risk levels, and alert leadership when high-risk indicators appear. By automating insight generation and escalation, finance leaders can make faster, data-driven decisions.

## Introduction

Your mission is to build an **AI-powered Financial Risk Advisor Copilot** that helps finance leaders shift from reactive reporting to proactive insight generation. Using Copilot Studio and Power Automate, you will design a conversational agent that can:

- Analyze uploaded financial documents such as quarterly reports and cash flow summaries
- Identify strengths, weaknesses, anomalies, and financial pressure indicators
- Classify business performance into **No Risk, Moderate Risk, or High Risk**
- Escalate high-risk findings to the CFO automatically via Outlook email
- Respond naturally inside Microsoft Teams with professional summary outputs

The solution reduces manual review effort, speeds up financial reporting, and ensures that high-priority risks are surfaced early and consistently.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Set up a Financial Risk Advisor Copilot using Copilot Studio
- Upload and configure financial documents as knowledge sources
- Build topics that evaluate revenue trends and cash flow using reasoning-driven prompts
- Automate escalation workflows using Power Automate for Outlook email notifications
- Publish the Copilot to Microsoft Teams for real-world enterprise use

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This is structured into five progressive challenges that model the lifecycle of a financial AI agent:

- **Challenge 01: Create the Financial Risk Advisor Copilot**  
  Configure the Copilot identity, purpose, and behavioral instructions.

- **Challenge 02: Upload Financial Knowledge Documents**  
  Add quarterly reports, cash flow statements, and other financial records as knowledge sources.

- **Challenge 03: Build Financial Analysis Topics**  
  Create two interactive topics for *Revenue Trend & Growth Drivers* and *Cash Flow Stability & Liquidity Outlook*.

- **Challenge 04: Configure Email Escalation Flow and Integrate it With the Copilot**  
  Trigger an Outlook email to the CFO automatically when high risk is detected and HR approves.

- **Challenge 05: Publish the Copilot to Microsoft Teams and Test the Full Workflow**  
  Deploy the Copilot to Teams and validate the complete analysis and escalation experience.

## Challenge Overview

You will begin by creating the Copilot foundation and uploading financial documents. You will then build conversational topics that ask clarifying questions, analyze the right reporting period, and classify business risk. Next, you will create an automated escalation workflow that emails a summary report to the CFO when high risk is detected. Finally, you will deploy the Financial Risk Advisor Copilot to Microsoft Teams and validate the full workflow in a real-world collaboration environment.

By the end of this Hack in a Day, you will have a **fully functional Financial Risk Advisor Copilot** capable of analyzing performance, highlighting anomalies, classifying risk levels, and escalating critical issues to leadership, all through a natural conversational interface.
