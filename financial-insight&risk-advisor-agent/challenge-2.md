# Challenge 02: Upload Financial Knowledge Documents

## Introduction
To help the Financial Risk Advisor Copilot answer finance-related questions and understand business context, we will enrich it with relevant financial reference documents.  
These files will later support trend interpretation and risk classification by providing grounding information such as revenue policies, cost structures, and financial health indicators.

In this challenge, you will upload **quarterly finance PDFs, cash flow reports, and financial policy sheets** to the Copilot knowledge base.

## Challenge Objectives
- Add financial documents as knowledge sources for the Copilot.
- Ensure data processed successfully.
- Enable the Copilot to reference these documents during responses.

## Steps to Complete
1. From the Copilot Studio home screen, open the **Financial Risk Advisor Copilot** created previously.
2. In the left navigation pane, select **Knowledge**.
3. Click **+ Add a knowledge source**.
4. Choose **Files** → **Upload file**.
5. Upload the financial reference documents provided which you downloaded and extracted earlier.
6. After uploading, verify each file shows the status **Processed**.

   >Note: This may take upto 30 minutes to get all the files uploaded and ready. Please continue further till the files get ready.

## Success Criteria
- All financial reference documents are uploaded and processed without errors.
