# Challenge 02: Upload Financial Knowledge Documents

## Introduction
To help the Financial Risk Advisor Copilot answer finance-related questions and understand business context, we will enrich it with relevant financial reference documents. These files will later support trend interpretation and risk classification by providing grounding information such as revenue policies, cost structures, and financial health indicators.

In this challenge, you will upload **quarterly finance PDFs, cash flow reports, and financial policy sheets** to the Copilot knowledge base.
