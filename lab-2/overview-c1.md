## Overview
In this lab, participants will learn how to use **Generative AI** to analyze manufacturing operational data and automatically generate insights and recommendations.  
You’ll ingest a synthetic manufacturing dataset, summarize trends, detect anomalies, and build a simple insights dashboard using Azure OpenAI Service and data-analysis tools.

The goal is to demonstrate how GenAI can turn raw machine and sensor logs into meaningful, human-readable narratives that accelerate decision-making on the factory floor.

## Problem Statement
Modern manufacturing plants generate terabytes of data daily—from machine sensors, quality checks, and maintenance logs.  
However, operators often struggle to interpret this data quickly. Manual report creation slows down root-cause analysis, causes missed optimization opportunities, and increases downtime.

## Solution Overview
You will build a **GenAI-powered data analysis assistant** that connects to operational data, performs automated summarization, and produces natural-language insights.  
Using **Azure OpenAI Service** (for LLMs such as gpt-35-turbo) and **Azure Storage** or **Synapse Notebook**, you will:
- Clean and transform manufacturing sensor data.  
- Use GenAI prompts to detect patterns and root causes.  
- Present results through a lightweight dashboard (Excel, Power BI, or Streamlit).  
This beginner-friendly lab focuses on concept demonstration rather than full-scale deployment.

## Challenges Overview

- **Challenge 01: Create and Review the Sample Manufacturing Dataset**  
Prepare the provided synthetic dataset, upload it to Azure Storage, and explore its structure. This challenge introduces the data you’ll analyze with GenAI.

- **Challenge 02: Deploy Azure OpenAI Service**  
Provision an Azure OpenAI resource and ensure access to the gpt-35-turbo model for generative data summarization.

- **Challenge 03: Analyze Data Using GenAI Prompts**  
Use the Azure OpenAI playground or a notebook to prompt the model for key insights and pattern detection from the dataset.

- **Challenge 04: Build a Summary Report and Dashboard**  
Transform GenAI outputs into visual summaries using Excel or Power BI to display trends and root-cause findings.

- **Challenge 05: Add a Chat-Style Interface for Insights**  
Create a simple chat UI (Streamlit / web form) to interact with your data and ask questions such as “Which machine had the most downtime this week?”

- **Challenge 06: Clean Up Resources**  
Delete all Azure resources to prevent extra charges and complete your GenAI data-analysis journey.
