# Challenge 03: Create Azure AI Search Resource and Import Manufacturing Data

## Introduction
To enable context-driven insights, Contoso Manufacturing needs a **searchable data layer** that the Large Language Model (LLM) can reference.  
Azure AI Search provides this capability — it allows you to index and query structured or unstructured data, forming the foundation for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** scenarios.

In this challenge, you’ll create an **Azure AI Search** service and import your manufacturing dataset into an index.  
This index will serve as the contextual knowledge base that the model will later use to generate accurate, data-grounded responses.

## Challenge Objectives
- Create an **Azure AI Search** resource.  
- Upload and import your manufacturing dataset into an **index**.  
- Validate that the indexed data can be queried successfully.  

## Steps to Complete

1. In the **Azure Portal**, select **Create a resource** → search for **Azure AI Search** → click **Create**.  
2. Under **Basics**, fill in the following details:
   - **Subscription:** Select your active subscription.  
   - **Resource Group:** Use `MFG-GENAI-RG`.  
   - **Service Name:** `mfg-search-<uniqueID>` (replace `<uniqueID>` with your initials or deployment ID).  
   - **Region:** Select *East US* or the same region as your OpenAI resource.  
   - **Pricing Tier:** Choose *Basic (B)* or *Free (F)*.  
3. Click **Review + Create** → **Create**.  
4. Once deployment completes, open your **Azure AI Search** resource and note:
   - **Endpoint URL**  
   - **Admin Key**

5. In the left pane, select **Import data**.  
6. For **Data Source**, choose **Azure Blob Storage**.  
7. Select the same Storage Account where you uploaded your manufacturing dataset (`machine_sensor_data.csv`).  
8. Name your data source: `mfg-datasource`.  
9. On the **Add cognitive skills (optional)** page, skip and click **Next**.  
10. On **Create an index**, name it `mfg-index`.  
    - Confirm that fields such as `MachineID`, `Temperature`, `Downtime`, and `Timestamp` are detected.  
11. Complete the wizard and click **Submit**.  
12. Once the index builds successfully, test it:  
    - In the **Search Explorer**, enter a query such as:  
      ```
      search=MachineID:102 OR Temperature gt 90
      ```  
    - Observe returned documents.

## Success Criteria
- Azure AI Search resource created successfully.  
- Manufacturing dataset indexed and searchable.  
- Queries return relevant data from your uploaded dataset.
