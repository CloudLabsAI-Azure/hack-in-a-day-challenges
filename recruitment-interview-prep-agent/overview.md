# Recruitment Interview Prep Agent

Welcome to the Recruitment Interview Prep Agent Hack in a Day! Today, you'll explore the power of AI-driven HR automation by building an intelligent recruitment assistant using Azure AI services and Copilot Studio. Through this hands-on experience, you'll learn how to design an end-to-end solution that can autonomously generate role-specific interview questions, evaluate candidate resumes, and provide intelligent scoring with explainable decision-making.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create an AI-powered HR Interview Copilot that transforms how organizations handle recruitment and interview preparation. Leveraging Azure AI Foundry, Azure OpenAI, Copilot Studio, and Power Automate, you'll design a system that can automatically parse resumes, generate contextual interview questions, evaluate candidate fit, and provide actionable insights—all while maintaining transparency and fairness in hiring decisions.

This solution will act as a comprehensive recruitment assistant integrating document processing, intelligent reasoning, conversational AI, and workflow automation to deliver faster, smarter, and more consistent hiring experiences for HR teams and candidates alike.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Set up Azure AI Foundry and Azure OpenAI for intelligent document processing and reasoning.
- Build automated resume parsing pipelines using Azure Document Intelligence.
- Create role-specific interview questions using advanced prompt engineering techniques.
- Develop AI-powered candidate evaluation systems with explainable scoring mechanisms.
- Integrate conversational AI into Microsoft Teams using Copilot Studio for seamless HR workflows.

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hack in a day adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through five progressive stages that mirror a real-world AI recruitment implementation. Each challenge focuses on a key capability of the HR Interview Copilot:

- **Challenge 1: Foundation** - Set up Azure AI environment and deploy OpenAI models for intelligent reasoning.
- **Challenge 2: Document Processing** - Build resume parsing and analysis pipeline using Azure Document Intelligence.
- **Challenge 3: Question Generation** - Create AI-powered system for generating role-specific interview questions.
- **Challenge 4: Candidate Evaluation** - Develop intelligent scoring and assessment system with explainable reasoning.
- **Challenge 5: Copilot Integration** - Build interactive HR Copilot interface in Microsoft Teams for seamless collaboration.

Throughout each challenge, you'll:
- Analyze the recruitment workflow requirements and business scenario.
- Strategize and design a scalable AI-powered HR solution.
- Leverage your Azure environment to deploy, integrate, and test AI components.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with setting up Azure AI infrastructure and deploying OpenAI models for advanced reasoning capabilities. You'll then implement document processing pipelines to parse and analyze candidate resumes. Next, you'll develop an intelligent question generation system that creates contextual, role-specific interview questions. Following that, you'll build a comprehensive candidate evaluation system with transparent scoring mechanisms. Finally, you'll integrate everything into a conversational Copilot interface deployed in Microsoft Teams.

By the end of this hack in a day, you'll have a fully functional HR Interview Copilot capable of automated resume parsing, intelligent question generation, fair candidate evaluation, and seamless team collaboration—all powered by explainable AI.
