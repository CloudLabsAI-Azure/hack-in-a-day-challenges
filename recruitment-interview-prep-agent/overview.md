# Recruitment Interview Prep Agent

Welcome to the Recruitment Interview Prep Agent Hack in a Day! Today, you’ll explore how AI can streamline HR operations by building an intelligent Copilot that assists with technical hiring. Through this hands-on lab, you will create a recruitment assistant capable of evaluating candidate resumes, generating role-specific interview questions, and sharing shortlist reports with hiring managers, all powered by Azure AI and Copilot Studio.

## Scenario

A fast-growing technology company is hiring for two critical roles , Software Developer and AI Engineer to support upcoming product launches. The HR team is receiving many resumes but is struggling to manually screen candidates, match their skills to job requirements, and prepare role-appropriate interview questions for each technical round. Important shortlisting updates for hiring managers are often delayed due to workload. To streamline this process, the company decides to build an HR Interview Copilot that can evaluate resumes, compare them to Job Descriptions, generate interview question sets based on experience level, and email shortlist reports to hiring managers for the next round. This ensures a faster, consistent, and more reliable hiring workflow.

## Introduction

Your mission is to build an **HR Interview Copilot** that supports recruitment teams in selecting the right candidate faster and more consistently. Using Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, Azure OpenAI, and Power Automate, you will design a conversational agent that can:

- Understand Job Descriptions for roles such as **Software Developer** and **AI Engineer**
- Analyze resumes against skill requirements and identify strengths and gaps
- Recommend whether a candidate should be shortlisted
- Generate tailored interview questions based on experience level and job role
- Email a structured shortlist report to the Hiring Manager for further evaluation

This solution reduces manual effort in hiring, improves collaboration between recruiters and interviewers, and ensures more objective and insight-driven decision-making.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this Hack in a Day, you will learn how to:

- Upload and manage knowledge sources in Copilot Studio for resume understanding
- Build topics that perform interactive resume evaluations and question generation
- Use reasoning-driven prompts to deliver explainable HR recommendations
- Automate interview workflows by emailing shortlist summaries through Power Automate
- Publish the HR Interview Copilot to Microsoft Teams for real-world usage

## Hack in a Day Format: Challenge-Based

This hands-on lab is structured into five progressive challenges that mirror a real HR automation implementation:

- **Challenge 1: Create the HR Interview Copilot**  
  Set up the Copilot with the right purpose, instructions, and conversational identity.

- **Challenge 2: Upload Recruitment Knowledge Sources**  
  Add Job Descriptions and sample resumes to the knowledge base for grounding.

- **Challenge 3: Build Resume Evaluation & Question Generation Topics**  
  Create two conversational topics — one for evaluating candidates and one for generating interview questions.

- **Challenge 4: Email Shortlist Reports to Hiring Managers**  
  Integrate Power Automate so the Copilot can send structured reports when HR approves.

- **Challenge 5: Publish the Copilot to Teams and Test the End-to-End Workflow**  
  Deploy the agent to Microsoft Teams and validate the full hiring experience.

Throughout each challenge, you will design, build, and test intelligent workflows that reflect real-world recruitment scenarios.

## Challenge Overview

You will start by creating the HR Interview Copilot framework and uploading key hiring documents. Next, you will implement resume evaluation and interview question generation using knowledge-grounded conversational intelligence. You will then automate shortlist reporting through Outlook email using Power Automate. Finally, you will deploy the Copilot to Microsoft Teams to experience the full, conversational hiring workflow.

By the end of this Hack in a Day, you will have a fully functional **HR Interview Copilot** that can evaluate technical candidates, prepare interview questions, email shortlist reports, and operate naturally inside Microsoft Teams, a complete and scalable HR automation solution.
