# Challenge 02: Upload Job Description and Resume Knowledge Documents

## Introduction
To help the HR Interview Copilot evaluate candidates and generate role-specific interview questions, we need to enrich it with relevant hiring reference documents.  
These documents will later support resume-to-job matching, scoring, and interview preparation by providing grounding information such as required skills, responsibilities, and experience expectations.

In this challenge, you will upload **Job Description PDFs and Resume PDFs** to the Copilot knowledge base.

## Challenge Objectives
- Add job descriptions and resumes as knowledge sources for the Copilot.
- Ensure all documents are fully processed.
- Enable the Copilot to reference these documents during responses.

## Steps to Complete
1. From the Copilot Studio home screen, open the **HR Interview Copilot** created previously.

1. In top navigation bar, select **Knowledge**.

1. Click **+ Add Knowledge**.

1. Choose **Upload files**.

1. Upload the Job Description and Resume documents provided, which you downloaded and extracted earlier.

1. After uploading, verify each file shows the status **Ready**.

   > Note: It may take up to 30 minutes for files to finish processing. You may continue to the next challenge while processing completes.

## Success Criteria
- All Job Description and Resume documents are uploaded and processed without errors.
