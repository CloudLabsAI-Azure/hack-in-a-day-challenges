# Challenge 05: Publish the Copilot to Microsoft Teams and Test the Full Workflow  

## Introduction
Your Financial Risk Advisor Copilot can now analyze financial reports, classify risk and send escalation emails when required.  
In this final challenge, you will publish the Copilot to **Microsoft Teams** so that finance stakeholders can interact with it directly inside their existing workflow.

Once published, you will add the Copilot to Teams and test the full end-to-end experience — including analysis and escalation.

## Challenge Objectives
- Publish the Copilot as a channel for Microsoft Teams.
- Add the Copilot to Teams for real-world testing.
- Verify that the complete workflow works correctly inside Teams.

### 3 — Test the Copilot Inside Teams
1. Open the Copilot from the Teams sidebar.
2. Ask questions such as:
   • *How is our revenue trending this quarter?*  
   • *What is the current liquidity outlook?*  
3. Confirm the following:
   • Copilot analyzes the uploaded financial data  
   • A risk level is clearly provided (No Risk / Moderate Risk / High Risk)  
   • If High Risk is detected, the Copilot asks whether the report should be sent to the CFO  
   • If the user selects **Yes**, the Outlook escalation flow is executed and email is sent  
   • If the user selects **No**, the conversation ends politely

## Success Criteria
- The Copilot appears and responds correctly inside Microsoft Teams.
- Analysis and risk classification behave the same as in Copilot Studio.
- The escalation email workflow triggers only when the user selects **Yes**.
- The final experience feels natural and conversational.
